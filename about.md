Hi! I’m **Neha**. I work at the intersection of bioinformatics and high‑performance computing, with a focus on **single‑cell** and **multi‑omics** analysis.  

**Interests:** scRNA‑seq, multi-omics integration, trajectory inference, and reproducible pipelines.

Outside work: mentoring, organizing and management, reading.
