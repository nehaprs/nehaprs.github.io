This is a growing list of books that have helped me become a better bioinformatician and a life scientist. Not training materials or study guides, obviously. This is a list of non-fictions that at some point I picked up as say, bedtime reads,
and ended up leaving a mark on my professional identity. This includes books that reminded me how meaningful our works are, how enjoyable the act of research is, or spotlighted the downstream effects we sometimes take for granted. 
The uniting factor of this list is that they all left me with the resources or drive to do better. I hope you too get to pick a favorite from here!


## The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot
The story of Henrietta Lacks is *the* book to be reckoned with in bioethics and has been fundamental to my understanding of biomedical research. Everyone you and I know have benefitted from the cells taken from this woman's body, which 
aided in the development of numerous drugs and vaccines, and continues to do so. The book juxtaposes it with the heart-wrenching human story. The book is exceptional in many ways, but most of all,
it aptly illustrates enduring and escalating questions about research use of human biospecimens.


## The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee
As far as popular literature is concerned, this is the most impactful text about cancer. It is comprehensive, beginning right from the prehistoric clues about the disease, and addresses every possible dimension of cancer studies, care, and cure.

It took me a year to finish reading the book. It being a 700+ page behemoth didn't help, but mostly because it is as heartbreaking as it is informative.
I couldn't go on beyond a few pages without a defeatist alarm on behalf of humankind - how, after all this time, this monster of a disease still eludes a comprehensive solution is oddly humbling and inspirational at once. 

## Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes by Svante Pääbo


## Machine Learning projects
<ul>
  <li>
 Developed models to integrate recursive algorithms with predictive analytics for disease
transmission. Used this to model the spread of COVID‑19 in Delaware.  <a href="https://github.com/nehaprs/LearningCovid" target="_blank">
    code
  </a>
  </li>

  <li>
 Developed a machine learning model to predict the co-occurrence of substance use disorders and mood disorders using publicly available datasets. <a href="https://github.com/nehaprs/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Mental%20Health" target="_blank">
    code

  </li>

  <li>
 Unsupervised integration of biomarker and clinical KPMP data to reveal subtypes of chronic kidney disease. Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) is characterized by gradual loss of the kidney's ability to filter waste from the blood. In this project, we combine clinical and biomarker data of patients diagnosed with CKD, obtained from The Kidney Tissue Atlas (https://atlas.kpmp.org/), to classify the various subtypes of the disease. <a href="https://github.com/nehaprs/KPMP_ML" target="_blank">
