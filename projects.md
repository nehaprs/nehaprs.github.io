Below are a few representative projects. Please reach out if you’d like more details or to work together.

## Single‑cell analyses {#single-cell}
• Single‑cell RNAseq analyses on mouse and frog models to study
the gene regulatory networks in neural crest migration during embryonic development.
• AI‑based and classical cell type annotations, integration, and trajectory analysis,
and data visualization with interpretation of the single-cell RNAseq data to trace the differentiation
of neural crest cell types.

## Multi‑omics integration {#multi-omics}
Applied genomic technologies to predict the substrates and targets of ADAM9 metalloproteinase
and understand its mechanism using colon cancer cell lines.
• Leverages sequencing methods, including differential expression analysis and machine learning,
to integrate RNAseq, Cellular Proteomics, and Secretomics Datasets.
• Regression models to predict 176 transcriptional and 1041 post‑transcriptional targets
of ADAM9, including 188 substrates with ranked levels of confidence.
• Pathway enrichment analysis to validate two downstream pathways.
• A computational and statistical proteotranscriptomics method is developed, applicable to different
membrane proteins with minimal modifications.

## Omics in drug development 
• Paired‑design RNAseq to study the effect of drug treatment on stag2 mutant mouse models.
• Drug sensitivity test for novel anti‑osteoarthritis drugs using RNAseq of bovine cartilage.

## Machine Learning projects
• Developed models to integrate recursive algorithms with predictive analytics for disease
transmission. Used this to model the spread of COVID‑19 in Delaware
• Developed a machine learning model to predict the co-occurrence of substance use disorders and mood disorders using publicly available datasets.
