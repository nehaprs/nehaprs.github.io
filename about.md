Hi! I’m **Neha**. I am a PhD Candidate in bioinformatics working on **single‑cell** and **multi‑omics** analyses. I have experience in building reproducible omics pipelines and multi-omics research, including, but not limited to, data integration, analysis, and visualization. I have worked with human, Xenopus, mouse, and bovine data.  

Outside of work, I am actively involved in various service and leadership activities. I have served as the president of my university's Bioinformatics Student Association and a member of the International Student Advisory Committee. I am currently a member of the Outreach Committee of the Association of Women in Science, Philadelphia. 

I am also an avid reader and I'm on a lifelong mission to build a personal library of books that are deeply meaningful to me. You can find some of my reviews and ratings at my   [goodreads page]([https://example.com](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32149277-neha-sindhu))
